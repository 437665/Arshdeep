        A specific kind of shark known as the blue shark lives in deep, warm ocean waters. The shark has a thin build, pale blue color, and can reach a length of ten feet. The blue shark is a marine mammal that can travel enormous distances and is found in oceans all around the world.
        They can give birth to as many as 135 offspring at once, and they eat squid and tiny fish. Despite their extensive distribution, blue sharks are considered nearly threatened due to overfishing. Although they don't threaten people, they could become hostile if provoked.  
        The ecosystems in which blue sharks reside depend on them, and as such, their protection is imperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/JyJJTf2rVd4?si=R-Ctv0nRkgiyQLHB">click here to learn more</a><br>

<h3 class="column-1">Habitat</h3>
<p class="row-1">Around the world, temperate and tropical oceans are home to blue shark populations. Located at the surface to around 3,280 feet deep, they are found in colder waters. Their long, lean physique and quick swimming are well known traits about them. Since their vivid blue backs aid in camouflage in the wide ocean, blue sharks get their moniker. Found in both open ocean and coastal regions, this species of shark is both oceanic and epipelagic. Their ability to travel faraway in the ocean makes them a migratory species. Their diet consists of young fish and squid, as they are an aggressive predator.

    <ol> <!--Use of ol(ordered list) tag-->
    <li><b>Size:</b>The adult male blue shark is slightly smaller, measuring about 6 to 7 feet, whereas the adult female is usually between 7 and 9 feet in length. Blue sharks are generally medium-sized sharks. Notwithstanding, certain people possess the capacity to grow larger; accounts exist of females attaining lengths of as long as 12 feet  and males reaching up to 10 feet.</li> n<!--Use of li(list  item) tag-->
<li><b>Body shape:</b> <div style="width: 80%; height: 250%;"><video controls>

  </video></div>They are able to move quickly through the water because of their long, slim bodies and fusiform, or torpedo, morphology. To facilitate effective mobility, their bodies are designed to shorten towards the tail.</li>
<li><b>Color:</b>Blue sharks get their common name from the distinctive bluish tint on their upper body. Depending on the shark's age and genetic variance, the colour can range from a deep indigo to a brighter blue-gray. When viewed from above or below by possible predators or prey, the blue shark's typically white belly serves to hide it.</li>
<li><b>Teeth:</b>Sharks, including blue sharks, have many rows of teeth. There are serrations on the edges of their triangular, sharp teeth. Since fish and squid make up a large amount of their diet, these teeth are ideal for capturing and devouring them.</li>
<li><b>Fins:</b>Blue sharks have multiple unique fin species. Unlike to other shark species, their primary dorsal fin, which is found on their back, is quite big and located further away back on the body. The other dorsal fin is situated towards the tail and is somewhat smaller. The major mode of propulsion for blue sharks are their long pectoral fins.</li>

<h3 class="column-1">Diet</h3>
<p class="row-1">Indeed! Although blue sharks eat a variety of foods, fish and cephalopods make up the majority of their diet. They are adept hunters that target small to medium-sized fish, including lanternfish, sardines, anchovies, herring, and mackerel. Blue sharks are skilled in catching these fish, which are frequently seen in schools.Blue sharks are attracted to squid in addition to fish. Their efficiency as cephalopod hunters allows them to capture and eat a variety of squid species, including those that inhabit deep-sea habitats.<br>
     A substantial portion of blue sharks' diet consists of squid.<br>
    In addition eating squid, blue sharks can also eat cuttlefish and octopus.<div style="width: 60%; height: 100%;">   <video controls >   <!--Use of video tag-->
        <source src="Shark.mp4" type="video/mp4" alt="Shark video">
        </video></p><br></div> Blue sharks are able to catch and eat these animals, which provide a good food supply.Since they are pelagic animals, blue sharks can find a variety of other pelagic fish species in the open ocean.<br> Many fish that are common in their habitat, such as swordfish, tuna, and other open-water fish, can be eaten by them opportunistically.<br>
    Squid, fish, and other cephalopods make up the majority of the blue sharks' varied diet. Scavenged food is also occasionally consumed. They can survive in their maritime habitat because of their capacity for adaptation and their ability to consume a variety of prey supplies.

<ul>   <!--Use of ul(unordered list) tag-->
<li><b>Lifespan:</b>In comparison to other shark species, blue sharks live comparatively long lives. Under ideal circumstances, they have a 20-year lifespan, if not longer.</li>  <!--Use of li (list items) tag-->
<li><b>Migration:</b>Long-distance migratory behaviour is characteristic of blue sharks. There are reports of certain people travelling thousands of kilometres across ocean basins on migration. In different seasons, they frequently head to sources of food or look for warmer waters.</li>
<li><b>Distribution:</b>Blue sharks are distributed around the world in both tropical as well as temperate waters. They are known to live in the Mediterranean Sea as well as the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans.</li>
